# SignatureRecognition
Signature recognition is the ability to identify and verify the authenticity of signatures with a 
high degree of accuracy. Signature recognition is an important application of pattern recognition 
and machine learning, and has many practical applications in fields such as finance, law 
enforcement, and security.
By studying signature recognition, one can develop an understanding of the various techniques 
and algorithms used for signature analysis, such as feature extraction, image processing, and 
classification. This includes understanding the features that make up a signature, such as stroke 
width, pressure, curvature, and speed, and how these can be used to distinguish between genuine 
and forged signatures.

Our signatures were trained using the VGG-16(Visual Geometry Group) identify 
True Positives and True Negatives. The code snippet is illustrated in the Implementation section.
